# Classic-ML-Algorithms-on-Nifty-Data

Here, I have implemented various classic ML algorithms on Nifty50 data. 
I have used various data preprocessing, cleaning and visualization methods and compared results.

All important theory points are explained in details in code notebook.

Data:
[Kaggle Nifty50 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/nifty50-stock-market-data)

Algorithms used:
1. Linear Regression
2. XGBRegression
3. Random Forest Regression

Note: This notebook is for learning about ML algorithms only and it is adviced not to apply any algorithm taken from here to direct trading. <br>This model doesn't works like real markets and hence may and should give wrong results if being used in real trading.
